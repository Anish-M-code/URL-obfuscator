FAQ

 - <b> My Website / Company website is in Active Redirect List will you remove it now? Did you hack our website? </b>

 You can open github issue if you want the website to be removed. It is better to fix on your backend than asking me to remove from this list .No I didn't hack website all open redirects present here are already exploited in public.
